about: Suggest a databaset to be integrated into webchem

Below are three criteria we use to evaluate and prioritize candidate databases for integration into the webchem package. Please respond to all three points.  If there is anything you are uncertain about (e.g. if you are unfamiliar with web scraping and can't tell how easy it'll be), please indicate that in your responses.

### Suggested database: <name and link to home page>

1. **Feasibility**.  Does the database provide an API?  If not, do you think it would it be easy to scrape?  [For example, database websites that have separate pages for each compound and provide data in a tabular format may be easier to scrape.] Note that if a database does not provide an API and explicitly forbids web-scraping, or is a paid service, it cannot be a candidate for integration into `webchem`.

2. **Scope**. What kind of data does the database contain? It should be primarily chemical properties, but databases of chemical identifiers or synonyms may also be considered.

3. **Overlap**.  How much does the database contents overlap with current databases that webchem can access? Does it provide unique properties and/or data on a unique set of chemicals? 

4. **Community need**.  Are these data likely to be used by a large constituency of users?  [Note that a database catering to a very narrow field may still be of use to a large number of users.]
