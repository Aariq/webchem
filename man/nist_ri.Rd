\title{Retrieve retention indices from NIST}
\usage{
nist_ri(cas, type = c("kovats", "linear", "alkane", "lee"),
  polarity = c("polar", "non-polar"), temp_prog = c("isothermal",
  "ramp", "custom"))
}
\arguments{
\item{cas}{CAS numbers either as numeric or formatted correctly with hyphens.}

\item{type}{Retention index type. One of `"kovats"`, `"linear"`, `"alkane"`, or `"lee"`. "kovats" returns Kovats retention indices, "linear" returns Van den Dool and Kratz retention indices, "alkane" returns normal alkane retention indices, and "lee" returns Lee retention indices. Details about how these are calculated here: [https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/gc-ri/].}

\item{polarity}{Column polarity. One of "polar" or "non-polar" to get RIs calculated for polar or non-polar columns.}

\item{temp_prog}{Temperature program. One of "isothermal", "ramp", or "custom".}
}
\value{
a table of literature RIs with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{`CAS` is the CAS number}
\item{`type` is the column type, e.g. "capillary"}
\item{`phase` is the stationary phase (column phase)}
\item{`RI` is retention index}
\item{`length` is column length in meters}
\item{`gas` is the carrier gas used}
\item{`substrate`}
\item{`diameter` is the column diameter in mm}
\item{`thickness` is the phase thickness in Âµm}
\item{`program`. Depending on whether you searched for "isothermal", "ramp", or "custom" there will be different columns describing the temperature program}
\item{`reference` is where this retention index was published}
\item{`comment`. I believe this is used to note the database these data were aggregated from}
}

\description{
This function scrapes NIST for literature retention indices given CAS numbers as an input.
