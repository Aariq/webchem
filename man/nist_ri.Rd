\title{Retrieve retention indices from NIST}
\usage{
nist_ri(cas, type = c("kovats", "linear", "alkane", "lee"),
  polarity = c("polar", "non-polar"), temp_prog = c("isothermal",
  "ramp", "custom"))
}
\arguments{
\item{cas}{CAS numbers either as numeric or formatted correctly with hyphens.}

\item{type}{Retention index type. One of `"kovats"`, `"linear"`,
`"alkane"`, or `"lee"`. See details for more.}

\item{polarity}{Column polarity. One of "polar" or "non-polar"
to get RIs calculated for polar or non-polar columns.}

\item{temp_prog}{Temperature program. One of "isothermal", "ramp",
or "custom".}
}
\value{
a table of literature RIs with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{`CAS` is the CAS number}
\item{`type` is the column type, e.g. "capillary"}
\item{`phase` is the stationary phase (column phase)}
\item{`RI` is retention index}
\item{`length` is column length in meters}
\item{`gas` is the carrier gas used}
\item{`substrate`}
\item{`diameter` is the column diameter in mm}
\item{`thickness` is the phase thickness in Âµm}
\item{`program`. various columns depending on the value of `temp_prog`}
\item{`reference` is where this retention index was published}
\item{`comment`. I believe this denotes the database these data
      were aggregated from}
}
}
\description{
This function scrapes NIST for literature retention indices
 given CAS numbers as an input.
}
\details{
The types of retention indices included in NIST include Kovats
 (`"kovats"`), Van den Dool and Kratz (`"linear"`), normal alkane
 (`"alkane"`), and Lee (`"lee"`). Details about how these are calculated
 are available on the NIST website:
 https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/gc-ri/
