`webchem` is a R package to retrieve chemical information from  the web. 
This package interacts with a suite of web APIs to retrieve chemical information.

The functions in the package that hit a specific API have a prefix and suffix separated by an underscore (`prefix_suffix()`).
They follow the format of `source_functionality`, with the exception of functions that retrieve database identifiers which follow the format of `get_identifier`. e.g.`cs_compinfo` uses ChemSpider to retrieve compound informations and `get_csid()` retrieves ChemSpider IDs.

## Fill out the survey!

Do you use chemical information databases in your work?  Help us help you by filling out our short survey at https://forms.gle/V7dfGGn73dkesn5L6. 

The `webchem` survey allows us to learn which databases you use and how you interact with chemical data. This is extremely valuable information for us and guides our development efforts. The survey takes about 5 minutes to fill out.

## Chemical databases currently accessed by webchem

At least some of the data in the following sources is accesible through `webchem` functions.  To learn more about what is available, browse the documentation [here](https://docs.ropensci.org/webchem/reference/index.html).
